# Weave

> Thread by thread, the image emerges — not from your hand alone, nor the machine's, but from the space between where meaning is made.

Weave is an open-source, local-first image generation system that replaces complex configuration interfaces with natural conversation.

:warning: This project is an early prototype :warning:

There are no gurantees that it works correctly.  See the [docs](./docs) for more details about the project.
