# Protected Files

Before modifying ANY file, check if it's protected:
- `README.md` DO NOT MODIFY
- `docs/**` DO NOT MODIFY  
- `.claude/**` DO NOT MODIFY
- `.gitignore` DO NOT MODIFY  
- `compute-daemon/.gitignore` DO NOT MODIFY

If a task seems to require modifying these, STOP and respond:
> "This task would require modifying [filename], which is protected. 
> Please clarify if this is intentional or if task needs adjustment."
